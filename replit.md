## Design Philosophy

This CRM follows a **Linear-inspired enterprise SaaS design system** with:
- Clean, professional aesthetic suitable for healthcare
- Consistent spacing and typography (Inter font throughout)
- Subtle interactions with hover/active states
- Information density balanced with readability
- Teal color scheme for medical trust and professionalism

## Deployment

### Docker (Local/Self-Hosted)
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Replit Production
Configured via `.replit` and `replit.nix` files.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## User Roles & Permissions

- **Admin**: Full system access including user/role management, ID patterns, backups
- **SalesManager**: Manage all CRM entities, view reports, assign leads
- **SalesRep**: Create/edit own records, convert leads, manage pipeline
- **ReadOnly**: View-only access to CRM data

## ID Pattern Examples

- Accounts: `ACCT-2025-00001`
- Contacts: `CONT-2501-00001`
- Leads: `LEAD-000001`
- Opportunities: `OPP-2025-000001`
- Activities: `ACT-2501-00001`

All patterns are configurable via Admin Console using tokens like `{PREFIX}`, `{YYYY}`, `{YY}`, `{MM}`, `{SEQ:n}`.
