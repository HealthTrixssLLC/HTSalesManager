# Ensure shell scripts always use LF line endings (Unix), never CRLF (Windows)
*.sh text eol=lf

# Docker files should also use LF
Dockerfile text eol=lf
docker-compose.yml text eol=lf
docker-entrypoint.sh text eol=lf

# Default behavior: convert to native line endings on checkout, but preserve on commit
