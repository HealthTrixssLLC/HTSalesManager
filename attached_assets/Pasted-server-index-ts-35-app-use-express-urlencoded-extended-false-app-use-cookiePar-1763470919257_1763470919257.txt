Description
Websites that rely on cookie-based authentication may be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Specifically, a state-changing request should include a secret token so the request can't be forged by an attacker. Otherwise, unwanted requests can be submitted on behalf of a user who visits a malicious website.
